"""
Do nothing. Then, do a *lot* of nothing.

This script sends the do_nothing command once per frame for a thousand trials.
Then, it sends it twice per frame, then four times per frame, etc.

This will output the FPS per number of times do_nothing is sent per frame.

This way, it is possible to gauge the effect that Command deserialization has on overall speed.
